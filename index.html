    <h1>Welcome to my HTML Journey: Step 1</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Gary Shatraw Jr. This is my first attempt at making an html page in <strong>this</strong> class. I hope to learn <strong>HTML, CSS, and JS</strong> 
  and learn to use them to make projects and help improve my senior project. I don't have much experience with web development, just a 
project in CSC 131, which was pretty rough given we had no training. My senior project will be adding features to our client's web page: 
<a href="http://peoplesense.city"> PeopleSense</a>. So far this has been fvery exciting, this class and all my classes here at SacState,
 I am looking forward to more!</p>
